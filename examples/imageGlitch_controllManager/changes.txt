The current version of GlitchSort, 1.0b10, was written specifically to run in Processing 2.0. It 
has changed very little from the previous version for 1.5.1, but will not run in that environment. 

I expect to post the Eclipse version to GitHub eventually. If you want the code now, before I get
it posted, please contact me. This code is published under the GNU Lesser General Public License
and is free for you or anyone else to use and modify.

 version  	1.0b10 for Processing 2.0
 				- various minor changes. The biggest change is that this version runs in Processing 2.0
 				- Same old manual
 				- save (s) and save a copy (S) commands, revert to saved (r) and revert to original (R)
 				- open file (o) and load file to snapshot buffer (O)
 				- rotate right (t) and rotate left (T)
 				- added zigzag percent number box, sets percent of blocks that get zigzag sorted on each pass
 				- ***** requires Processing 2.0, processing.org  *****
 				- ***** requires ControlP5 2.0.4, www.sojamo.de/code ***** 
 				- The Processing version has been broken into tabs to make it easier to view the code.
 version	1.0b9 for Processing 1.5.1
 				- added '_' (underscore) key command to turn 4 times repeating lastCommand
 				- fixed dragging to work both when control panel is visible and when it is not, 
 				  without shift key--covers most cases, but doesn't track collapsed panels
 				- added scaledLowPass method, low pass filter each RGB channel with different 
 				  FFT block size (64, 32, 16), component order depends on current Component Sorting Order setting
                Currently only triggered with ')' key command, works best when pixel dimension are multiples of 64.
 				- added ZigzagStyle enum and zigzagStyle variable to set zigzag sorting to random angles, aligned angles, 
 				  or angles permuted in blocks of four
 				- added global variables for control panel location and width
 				- added flipX and flipY methods to Zigzagger to handle changing zigzag angle
 				- changed default settings of statistical FFT
 				- various small fixes 
 version 	1.0b8a
 				- changes from last version
 				- fixed denoise command to include edge and corner pixels
 				- added lastCommand variable, tracks last key command in "gl<>9kjdGLKJD" 
 				- Version 1.0b8 included a new reference manual 
 
 If the manual wasn't included, see http://paulhertz.net/factory/2012/08/glitchsort2/.

ISSUES as of version 1.0b10
0. Processing 2.0 resolved the image memory leak problem: this version of GlitchSort runs in Processing 2.0 (not 1.5.1!).
1. Type 'r' (reload) or 'f' fit to screen after loading the first picture to get correct window size. (Processing 1.5.1).
2. Using return key to load a file from the file dialog sometimes causes application to hang. Double-click works.
3. The display window may still hide a row or two of pixels, though I think I have 
   fixed this. You can drag it a little bigger.
4. Audify ('/' and '\' is new and still kludgy, but the bugs that would cause a crash in 
  1.0b7 pre-release "c" seem to have been fixed.
5. The Minim library routines I use for FFT are now deprecated, but functional. 
6. There must be other issues.
